# Sentiment Analysis with RNN
Implementing Recurrent Neural Networks, particular LSTMs, to perform sentiment analysis in Keras.Sentiment analysis probably is one the most common applications in Natural Language processing. No need to emphasize how important customer service tool, sentiment analysis has become.Train a classifier on IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews, using Recurrent Neural Networks.

# Dataset
* We are using IMDB Dataset to train our model.<br>
* [IMDB dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics.

# Approach
* Download the Dataset
* Data Preprocessing 
* Lemmatization
* Build the Model
* Train the Model
* Predict the output / Test the Model
* Predict the output for custom input
